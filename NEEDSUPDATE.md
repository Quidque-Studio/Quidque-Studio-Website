# This is a list of things that need fixes or changes

## UI / UX

### General

#### Freeform Content

- Images in Blogs, Devlogs, News, and member's about me sections should be smaller.
- Spacing between the various blocks is too large

#### Single Project Page

- "Team" And "Resources" should be next to each other, not on top of each other.
- Gallery should auto swap images after a time period

#### Member Pages

- The custom colorpalette should cover the "full" colorpalette, and change the root variables rather than just certain parts
  - That means also allowing for the user to update even more than the current colors in the settings
- In the settings, there should be a way to preview based on the selected colorpalette
  - There should also be a "reset all" button

### Admin

#### General UX

- Generally, the admin pages could use more mobile optimization

#### Users

- Permissions other than "manage_users" don't work at the moment (backend issue)
