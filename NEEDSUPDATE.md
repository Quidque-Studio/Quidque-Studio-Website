# This is a list of things that need fixes or changes

## UI / UX

### General

#### Home

- Recent activity should also include recent member blog posts.

#### Sidebar / Nav

- Collapsed and Expanded states should be seperate for better UI

#### Images

- Images in Blogs, Devlogs, News, and member's about me sections should be smaller.

#### Single Project Page

- "Team" And "Resources" should be next to each other, not on top of eachother.
- Gallery should auto swap images after a time period

#### Member Pages

- The custom colorpalette should cover the "full" colorpalette, and change the root variables rather than just certain parts
- In the settings, there should be a preview based on the selected colorpalette
  - There should also be a "reset all" button

### Admin

#### General UX

- If you click a list item, it should do the same as the first action (View/Edit/Devlogs), as it's the most common thing to click
- Content blocks in editor should work like accordion to save space and better UX.
- The list actions are hard to use in mobile mode
- Generally, the admin pages seem hard to use in mobile mode
- Maybe a search for the list pages

#### Dashboard

- Make the various dashboard stats clickable for navigation
- Add some more "spice" to the dashboard

#### Sidebar / Nav / Bottom Nav

- Gotta make bottom nav have fewer icons
- Maybe rework how all of admin is navigated

#### Projects

- The back button from devlog menu should go back to previous page. (Project Edit -> Devlog -> Project Edit | Project List -> Devlog -> Project List)
- Better resources & links editor UI for desktop

#### Tech Stack

- Drag & Drop doesnt work

#### Messages

- Admins should be able to delete conversations
- Messages timestamp should be above the name instead of next to it
- Messaging area should be scrollable, or keep the input "on top" of it, while auto scrolling to the latest messages.

#### Users

- User editor should be split in two:
  1. The default "always available" section with "Name", "Email", "Role"
  2. The "if team member" section with permissions
- Also, permissions other than "manage user" don't work at the moment
