# This is a list of things that need fixes or changes

## UI / UX

### General

#### Home

- Recent activity should also include recent member blog posts.

#### Sidebar / Nav

- Collapsed and Expanded states should be separate for better UI

#### Images

- Images in Blogs, Devlogs, News, and member's about me sections should be smaller.

#### Single Project Page

- "Team" And "Resources" should be next to each other, not on top of each other.
- Gallery should auto swap images after a time period

#### Member Pages

- The custom colorpalette should cover the "full" colorpalette, and change the root variables rather than just certain parts
- In the settings, there should be a preview based on the selected colorpalette
  - There should also be a "reset all" button

### Admin

#### General UX

- Generally, the admin pages could use more mobile optimization

#### Projects

- Better resources & links editor UI for desktop

#### Users

- Permissions other than "manage_users" don't work at the moment (backend issue)
